# Zombie Emergence!

## Zombie Emergence! `Class`

Mura is the brain and revolution designer of Weniv. She is also the head of `Walnut`, a secret organization in Weniv World.

> "Revolution is like music. If it doesn't impress us, it won't succeed."

Mura received the Time Stone and returned to `Catsfish`. Then, she began gathering information using the secret passage of the royal family.

At the moment she was collecting information along with Hati and ZeeZee, members of `Walnut`,

> 'This is the trace of dark magic!'

It felt ominous, but it was already too late. Zombies were appearing everywhere, and the passage they had entered through was blocked.

At that moment, a monster floating in the air wearing red clothes and holding something like a magic wand spoke up.

> "You've seen and heard what you shouldn't. Who are you? How did you come here?"

Mura didn't reply but spoke to Hati and ZeeZee.

> "Hati, ZeeZee. Open the way. I have the Time Stone, so I can return to this moment anytime. I'll find a way to escape from here, even if it takes a thousand times."

Mura activated the Time Stone.

### Mission
Create a `PathRecorder` class to record the path taken and use it to calculate a route to escape safely from the zombies. Implement functionality to record Mura's movements and to return along the same path in reverse.

1. Based on the data recorded until reaching the destination through the maze,
2. avoid zombies and return to the original position.

### Basic Data
```python
class PathRecorder:
    # Define class
    pass

path_recorder = PathRecorder()
```

## Hints
```python
class PathRecorder:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def record_step(self, location):
        pass

    def retrace_steps(self):
        pass
```
