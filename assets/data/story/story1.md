# Cat’s Resolution 

## Cat’s Resolution  `move` `pick` `say`


Weniv World is a world of ruthless survival. Powerful ones dominate, and the weak are stripped and starved of hunger. It is also a place where magic and machinery coexist.

Cat is a commoner who runs a fish market on the outskirts of Weniv World. In the early morning, he ventures into the treacherous sea to catch fish on behalf of his ailing mother, and he sells the fish in the afternoon. He repeats this routine daily.

> "Please take care of this fish market, my son…"

His mothers' illnesses worsened. In Weniv World, however, the hospital is a place only nobles can access. It’s a brutal place for commoners where even death goes unnoticed.

> "What I need to do best now is catch and sell fish, meow!"

Cat decided to do what he could. He got up every day no matter how hard it was. He tried to keep his mind not to show his weakness.

> "I'll build a hospital that even commoners can come, meow!"

Cat got healthy food and medicine with the money he earned every day to take care of his sick mother. He also trained himself to catch more fish and explored difficult skills day and night.

As time went on, his skills improved day by day. No one in Weniv World could catch as many fish as Cat.
