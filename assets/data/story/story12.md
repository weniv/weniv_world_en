# Licat’s Determination: Becoming a King

## Licat’s Determination: Becoming a King `Iteration Statement` `Conditional Statement` `Set`

Despite raising enough money to establish a hospital, Licat's plan faced fierce opposition. He gathered strength and invested money in innovation, but he fell short of creating a new path and achieving a significant miracle.

Licat left Lion Town and returned to the village where he was born. Whenever he came out, many people who waited for Licat gathered like clouds.

One day, Licat heard a strange rumor among people.

> "Have you heard the rumor that if you find the seven algorithm stones hidden by Pie and Sun, you can gain the mighty power to make a wish come true? They announced it recently!"

Upon hearing this, Licat pondered.
