# Warehouse Integration

## Warehouse Integration `List` `Arithmetic Operation` `Iteration Statement` `Type Casting`

Pika is a strategist. With much experience in launching services, Pika is taking care of all plans at `CatsFish Inc.`

The warehouse of `CatsFish` is full, and there is no place to store fish anymore. Therefore, Pika wants to build a large warehouse to store fish. The problem is how many floors the warehouse should have.

> "Oh, this should be fun."

Pika likes challenging plans. He plans to calculate the growth rate of `CatsFish` and build a warehouse that is 10 times the total number of fish in the warehouse.

Each new floor of the warehouse will be able to store 100 fish. Help Pika calculate how many floors of the warehouse are needed and output the result to the terminal.

## Mission

Each line represents one warehouse. From right to left, it stands for fish in the ones place, tens place, and hundreds place. For example, if there are 2 fish at (0, 3) and 4 fish at (0, 4), the warehouse has a total of 24 fish.

The new warehouse needs to be built to hold 10 times the fish in the warehouse, so we need a warehouse that can store 240 fish. Since each floor can store 100 fish, a total of 3 floors are needed.

Put all the fish in the warehouse into a `list` and output to the terminal how many floors of the warehouse need to be built.


### Basic Code
```python
l = [0, 0, 0, 0] # [Thousands place, Hundreds place, Tens place, Ones place]
```

```python
for i in l:
    print(i)
```


## Hints
Complete the mission by combining the codes below.
```python
int(10.3)
mission_start()
mission_end()
on_item()
move()
repeat(2, move)
pick()
print('hello world!')
item()
item()['fish-1']
10 + 10
10 * 3
10 // 3
10 % 3 == 0
10 >= 20
30 < 10
```
