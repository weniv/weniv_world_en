# Is This a Bank or a Fish Market?

## Is This a Bank or a Fish Market? `Comparison Operation` `Built-in Function` `List`

Licat wanted to establish a hospital, but he thought earning money could not be the only goal of `CatsFish Inc.` He believed that the company's goal was to produce value together, and above all, the happiness of employees.

To make them happy, Licat made efforts to secure more spare time and not to let them work late into the night and on weekends.

Therefore, they needed a productivity improvement. How could productivity be increased? How could more be produced in less time and more rest be secured?

> "It's a system! We need to grow together by changing the system!"

The size of the company became too big to change the whole system, so they decided to change the small part first.

First of all, they took a day off when the fish were sold least. And on days when there were the most sales, they held events so that they could earn more profits.

Help Licat establish the system of `CatsFish`!


## Mission

Each cell represents the amount of money that fish were sold on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Fish has not been sold yet on Friday, so it remains as fish only. The gold bar is 100,000 nodes, and fish-3 is 3,000 nodes.

1. Pick up all the gold bars sold each day and store them in a list.
2. What is the minimum amount sold on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday? Use `min()` to print the minimum amount of money on the terminal.
3. On which day was the most sold? Print the day on the terminal. An event will be held on this day.
4. On which day was the least sold? Print the day on the terminal. On this day, the store is closed.

### Output

```python
Minimum sales: 30000
Event day: Monday
Day off: Friday
```
