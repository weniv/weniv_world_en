> “Every day is so exhausting. Do I have to do this much? Why do I work and what more can I do in the future?”


With these various thoughts still unorganized, Licat went to `CatsFish` market and started to clean it. 

The market was scattered with gold bars and fish. The more he cleaned, the more he could clear his mind.

Letting thoughts just go and focusing on simple tasks, only important things remained and the things had somehow simplified.


## Mission

Create the following dictionary and write a code to print the number of gold bars and the number of fish in the terminal.

### Basic Code

```python
d = {'goldbar': 0, 'fish': 0}
```


## Hints
Complete the mission by combining the codes below.
```python
mission_start()
mission_end()
item()['goldbar'] += 1
item().get('goldbar', 0)
move()
on_item()
turn_left()
repeat(2, move)
pick()
print('hello world!')
front_is_clear()
left_is_clear()
right_is_clear()
```
