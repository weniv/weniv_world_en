## Advent of Licat  `move` `pick` `say`

![Licat caring for his mother](./2.webp)

Cat's mother eventually couldn't overcome her worsening condition. Holding back tears, Cat did his best to show a smile on her final journey. Nevertheless, he was in full despair for being helpless to do anything.

Not to let sorrow pull him down, he kept to stay busy. He had lost his family, but he wanted to protect someone else's family by building a hospital. As time passed, Cat grew. He could catch more fish than anyone else, and there was no shop in town larger than Cat’s fish market. However, the hospital remained an unachievable dream.

> "At this rate, it would take 100 million and 3299 years to build a hospital, meow…"

Cat decided to enter **Lion Town** to earn a huge amount of money. Lion Town is a place where only royal and noble lions can live. For commoners, only selected individuals could enter this town.

After a lot of thought, Cat came up with a clever idea.


> "I can just wear a lion mask and get in, meow!"

He called himself Licat after Cat wearing a lion mask. Licat thought it would be easy to enter Lion Town, but the gatekeepers were not as lenient as he expected. Denied entry after a strict inspection, he had to agonize again.

At that moment, a staff named Mura came to give him information. Mura looked calm and cold-hearted, so it was difficult to know what she was thinking. But every time she said a word, she was of great help to Licat.

> "There is a **secret passage to Lion Town**. If you pass there, it would lead to an outskirt of Lion Town. There are few people and they don't conduct inspections, so you should be able to live there comfortably in those clothes. I hope you achieve the dream you want."

Licat expressed gratitude to Mura and moved to the location. The secret passage was at the end of a complex maze. When Licat placed his hand on the door, it began to speak!


> *"**This door is only for those with the qualifications of the king!** From now on, I will verify your qualifications! Grrrr!!"*
