# Free Food Truck

## Free Food Truck `Conditional Statement` `Logical Operation`

Licat has been secretly moving gold bars outside of Lion Town.

> 'They can buy snacks for 1 gold in Lion Town, but in Weniv World, 10 families can live with the money for 10 months, meow!'

He selected reliable employees and raised money with gold bars. And with the money, heâ€™s been running a food truck for a long time.

> "I'll take care of the food, meow! So don't worry about what to eat, what to wear, and where to sleep. Spend time for bigger value, meow!"

Most didn't know who ran the food truck, but many thanked for it. As time passed, some of them figured out who was running the food truck and secretly followed Licat.

Among them, Hati had been watching the food truck coming to the village where she was born for a long time.

Working as a spy on `CatsFish` market, she could find out who was running a food truck. Even though she was a spy, she became swayed by his sincerity.

## Mission

If there are 10 or more fish-1 and 10 or more gold bars, Licat enters the space (1, 4), puts a fish-1, and says that he is running a food truck.

Otherwise, he should say that the food truck is not running in the space (1, 4). Both conditions must be satisfied.


### Basic Code

```python
if condition:
    say('We are running a food truck!')
else:
    say('We are not running a food truck!')
```
