The fish caught on Skull Island is so plump and delicious that its popularity has been increasing as days go by. Even people from other villages were willing to pay more to buy the fish.

Today, let's calculate how much revenue we can make when all the displayed fish are sold.

## Mission

Pick up all the `fish` in the market and calculate how much revenue can be achieved when selling fish-1 for 1000 nodes, fish-2 for 2000 nodes, and fish-3 for 3000 nodes. Output the result as shown below in the terminal. The `count` should be printed using `item()`, and the total should be the value obtained by multiplying `price` and `count`.

```python
type    count   price   total
fish-1  2       1000    2000
fish-2  3       2000    6000
fish-3  5       3000    15000
total                   23000
```


## Hints
Complete the mission by combining the codes below.
```python
mission_start()
mission_end()
move()
repeat(2, move)
pick()
print('hello world!')
print('hello', 'world')
print(f'hello world')
item()
item()['fish-1']
