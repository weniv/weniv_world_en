# Licat and Gemstones

## Licat and Gemstones `Built-in Function` `Unpacking`

Team Licat successfully solved the final problem and secured seven gemstones from the mystical island of Jeju. Each gemstone emitted a brilliant light, and it seemed to illuminate Licat's path.

Despite not having materialistic desires, Licat suppressed the surging possessiveness and thought:

> "This power is too great and deadly for one person to possess, meow."

Licat quietly closed the box, and neither Javadog nor Gary said anything. After a while, Licat asked his two colleagues what they wanted.

Gary and Javadog responded almost at the same time:

> "We hoped to fairly divide these gemstones we found together, but!"

They had already seen the world Licat dreamed of, and if they could bring about some change together, the gems didn't matter. Gary and Javadog had seen something even greater than what they initially desired.

> "Okay, meow!"

Licat decided to distribute the seven stones to seven individuals.

- Reality Stone: Can manipulate people's vision to create illusions similar to reality.
- Soul Stone: Can see the world of wisdom and the soul.
- Mind Stone: Can manipulate the mind.
- Time Stone: Can control time.
- Space Stone: Can create arbitrary space.
- Power Stone: Gains power.
- Peace Stone: Attains the state of absolute transcendence, always maintaining tranquility.

For several days, Licat gathered trustworthy friends, those who had supported him during his journey.

> "Nothing means anything if it's not together, meow!”

Licat felt the need for power for the revolution. This power could be the inherent power, the power of capital, or the power of influence.

> "Everyone, go back to your hometowns, practice using the power of the stones, gather strength, and stand by for a call! Build up your strength, meow."

Those who received the stones embarked on a long journey.
