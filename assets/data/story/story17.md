# Licat’s Sincerity: Catching Fish

## Licat’s Sincerity: Catching Fish `Built-in Function` `Sorting`

Returning to its hometown, Licat looked around the neighborhood that had undergone many changes with the help of `CatsFish Inc.` Even in the enriched village, light and shadow coexisted. He had to organize and determine what to improve and how.

Licat built a cabin overlooking the sea. He crafted a boat himself and brought the nets and fishing rod he had at home. Every morning, he caught fish and quietly shared them with those lying in the shaded areas.

With each fish he caught, Licat pondered how small he was, and yet how capable this small self could be. He discerned what he could and couldn't do, checked if his initial determination was still intact, and thought about how to face the challenges ahead.

"Handle important matters with priority. Foster enthusiasm for what you can do, and let go of what is beyond your control. While empathizing with each individual's feelings, a cold judgment is also essential. I will cultivate the qualities of a leader here first."

A peace stone was gleaming on Licat’s wrist.

Licat reflected on the journey so far and considered if there were ways to handle similar situations more wisely. He could calmly reflect on himself and his embarrassing moments. Additionally, he thought about colleagues who had been with him.

Despite catching plenty of fish, Licat released them all except for those for meals or sharing. Because what Licat truly sought to catch wasn't the fish itself.

### Mission
Catch all the fish on the map, sort them in order of the most caught, and output them to the terminal as follows. `fish-1` is at the forefront since it was caught the most.

```python
[('fish-1', 7), ('fish-3', 5), ('fish-2', 3)]
```

## Hints
Complete the mission by combining the codes below.
```python
sorted(l, key=lambda x:len(x))
d.items()
from modules import turn_right, turn_around
```
